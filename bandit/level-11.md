## Level 10 to 11

Goal: find the password stored in `data.txt`, which is encoded in base64.

What was done:

`ls`                       -> confirmed that `data.txt` was present in the home directory

`cat data.txt | base64 -d` -> passed the contents of `data.txt` to `base64` and decoded the base64-encoded text

After logging in, `ls` was used to confirm that `data.txt` was present in the home directory.

The goal stated that the password was stored in the file using base64 encoding. The `base64` command was researched to determine how to decode the encoded text. The `-d` option was found to decode base64 input back into its original text representation.

The command was then constructed using a pipeline: `cat data.txt | base64 -d`. `cat data.txt` read the contents of the file and passed them through the pipe as standard output. The `base64 -d` command then received that input and decoded it. The decoded output contained the password.

What was understood:
- The `base64` command can be used to encode and decode base64 data.
- The `-d` option tells `base64` to decode the input.
- `|` passes the output of one command to the input of another.
- `cat data.txt` can be used to read a file and pass its contents through a pipeline.
- No new major concept was required for this level; the main addition was understanding the `-d` option of `base64`.

Vulnerability type: this level demonstrates how encoded data can be transformed back into its original representation using standard command-line utilities. Base64 is an encoding mechanism rather than encryption, meaning encoded data can be decoded when the encoding method is known.

Real world version: base64 is frequently used to represent data in applications, APIs, configuration files, authentication mechanisms, and other systems. Treating base64-encoded data as if it were encrypted can lead to sensitive information being exposed when the encoded value is decoded.
