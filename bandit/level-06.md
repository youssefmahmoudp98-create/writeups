## Level 5 to 6

Goal: find the password stored in a human-readable file that is 1033 bytes in size and is not executable.

What was done:

`ls -a`                    -> inspected the home directory and located `inhere`

`cd inhere`                -> entered the directory

`ls`                       -> listed `maybehere00` through `maybehere20`

`file -l maybehere*`       -> produced a large amount of output because `-l` has a command-specific meaning and is not a universal "long format" option

`file maybehere*`          -> identified the `maybehere` entries as directories

`find . -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -i "ascii"` -> searched for regular files and filtered their `file` output for ASCII text

`find . -type f -size 1033c` -> located the file with a size of exactly 1033 bytes

`cat ./<filename>`         -> displayed the password

`find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} \; | grep -i "ascii"` -> combined the known conditions into a single search

After logging in, `ls -a` was used to inspect the home directory and locate `inhere`. The `cd` command was then used to enter the directory with `cd inhere`.

The contents were listed with `ls`, which displayed `maybehere00` through `maybehere20`.

The first attempt was `file -l maybehere*`. The `-l` option was initially assumed to have a similar purpose to the `-l` option used with `ls`, but this produced a large amount of output containing many file signatures. This demonstrated that command-line options are interpreted by the individual programs receiving them and do not have universal meanings across commands.

The next attempt was `file maybehere*`. The `*` wildcard was used to target all entries matching the `maybehere` pattern. The output showed that the entries were directories, meaning the files being searched for were located inside them.

After reaching this point, `find` was researched as a way to search through the directory structure. The following command was then used: `find . -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -i "ascii"`.

The `find` command was used to search for entries. The `.` represented the current directory, which was `inhere`.

`-type f` restricted the results to regular files.

`-exec file {} \;` caused the `file` command to be executed for each file found by `find`. `{}` represented the current file being processed. The `\;` marked the end of the `-exec` expression. The semicolon was escaped so that Bash did not interpret it as shell syntax and instead passed it to `find` as part of the expression.

The output from `file` was then passed through the pipe to `grep -i "ascii"`. `grep` filtered the output for occurrences of `ascii`, while `-i` made the search case-insensitive. This allowed the human-readable file to be identified from the output produced by `file`.

The size requirement was then applied with `find . -type f -size 1033c`. The previous `find` concepts remained the same, while `-size 1033c` restricted the search to files with a size of exactly 1033 bytes. The `c` specified that the size was measured in bytes.

The resulting file was then read with `cat ./<filename>`, which displayed the password.

Out of curiosity, all of the conditions were then combined into a single command:

`find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} \; | grep -i "ascii"`

The only new concept in this command was `!`. In this context, `!` negated the following `find` test. Therefore, `! -executable` meant that the file must not be executable.

What was understood:
- Command-line options are interpreted by the individual programs receiving them and do not have universal meanings.
- `find` can be used to search through a directory structure using multiple conditions.
- `.` represents the current directory when used as the starting point for `find`.
- `-type f` restricts `find` to regular files.
- `-exec` allows a command to be executed for each result produced by `find`.
- `{}` represents the current file being passed to the command executed by `find`.
- `\;` marks the end of the `-exec` expression, with the semicolon escaped so Bash does not interpret it.
- `file` can be used to determine the type and characteristics of a file.
- `grep -i` can filter command output for a specific string without considering letter case.
- `-size 1033c` specifies a file size of exactly 1033 bytes.
- `!` can negate a `find` condition, allowing `! -executable` to specify files that are not executable.
- `*` can act as a wildcard in shell filename expansion, matching a sequence of characters.
- Multiple conditions can be combined into a single `find` command instead of checking each requirement separately.

Vulnerability type: this level demonstrates how command-line tools interpret options, filenames, wildcards, and other special syntax. Incorrect assumptions about how a command interprets its arguments can lead to unexpected behavior, particularly when filenames or other inputs are controlled externally.

Real world version: the same concepts appear in scripts and applications that process filenames or other command-line arguments. Incorrect handling of special characters, wildcards, options, or user-controlled input can cause programs to interpret data as control information or operate on unintended files.
